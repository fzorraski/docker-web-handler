## Runni'n the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `docker-web-handler-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory. <br>

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/docker-web-handler-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/docker-web-handler-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
